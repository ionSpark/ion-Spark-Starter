Spark Example Spec---
Install the Ionic CLI
Also install scss for Ionic framework.
For a indepth information go to ionicframework.com.

Starting an Ionic App
$ ionic start test https://github.com/ionSpark/ionic-spark.git
["test" is the name of you new app, whatever you would like it to be ;)]

Open gulpfile.js and add...

,'./www/spark/**/*.scss'

to this

var paths = {
  sass: ['./scss/**/*.scss']
};

so your left with this

var paths = {
  sass: ['./scss/**/*.scss','./www/spark/**/*.scss']
};

Now that includes your css files

Finally,

copy your ion-spark projects to the folder spark.

include your javascript in you index.html file

<script src="spark/name-of-module/module.js"></script>

and add them as modules to your app

angular.module('app', ['ionic', 'app.controllers', 'app.routes', 'app.services', 'app.factorys','app.directives', 'spark.walkthroughExample'])

Thats it now your walkthough page is install

$ ionic serve
