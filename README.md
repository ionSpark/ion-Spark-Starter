<h1>IonSpark Starter</h1>

This project aims to let you start a new app as fast as possible and add pages by copying folders to the spark directory.

Just clone it and you are ready to go! 
Feel free to open an issue for any question or suggestion you could have.


<h3>Getting started</h3>
<ul>
<li>install nodejs, npm, gulp, bower, cordova, ionic & sass (if not already done)</li>
<li>git clone https://github.com/ionSpark/ion-spark.git : clone this repo</li>
<li>cd ionic-starter : go to folder</li>
<li>bower install : install app dependencies</li>
<li>npm install : install build dependencies</li>
<li>ionic setup sass : use sass</li>
<li>ionic serve : start the app on your browser</li>
</ul>

<strong>Run all these commands at one time :</strong><br> git clone https://github.com/ionSpark/ionic-spark.git && cd ion-spark && bower install && npm install && ionic setup sass && ionic serve


As it's only a template project, you may want to change its name. For that, you just have to open :
<ul>
<li>config.xml (widget id, name, description & author)</li>
<li>www/index.html (title)</li>
<li>bower.json (name, homepage, author & description)</li>
<li>package.json (name & description)</li>
<li>ionic.project (name)</li>
</ul>
