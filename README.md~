<h1>IonSpark Starter</h1>

This project aims to let you start a new app as fast as possible and add pages by copying folders to the spark folder.

Just clone it and you are ready to go! 
Feel free to open an issue for any question or suggestion you could have.


<h3>Getting started</h3>
<ul>
<li>install nodejs, npm, gulp, bower, cordova, ionic & sass (if not already done)</li>
git clone https://github.com/ionSpark/ion-spark.git : clone this repo
cd ionic-starter : go to folder
bower install : install app dependencies
npm install : install build dependencies
ionic setup sass : use sass
ionic serve : start the app on your browser

Run all these commands at one time : git clone https://github.com/ionSpark/ionic-spark.git && cd ion-spark && bower install && npm install && ionic setup sass && ionic serve

config.xml (widget id, name, description & author)
www/index.html (title)
bower.json (name, homepage, author & description)
package.json (name & description)
ionic.project (name)
